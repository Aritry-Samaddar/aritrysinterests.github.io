          <br><b>1. You are the Best Wife</b>
          <li class="ajay">
            Ajay believes in living for himself; Bhavna teaches him to live for others. Ajay is
a planner for life; Bhavna makes him live in every moment.
You are the Best Wife is a story of two people with contradictory ideologies who
fall in love. It changes them for good. It changes the way they look at the world
and the way the world looks at them. Until destiny reveals its plans.
This is a true inspiring story of the author and his struggle with life, after his
beloved wife left him halfway through their journey. But her last words, ‘you are
the best husband’ gave him the strength to live on, and fulfil his promise of love.
Told with frankness and doses of humor, this heartwarming tale of a boy and a
girl who never gave up on their love in face of adversities, ends on a bittersweet
and poignant note as Ajay comes to terms with the biggest lesson life has to
offer.

          <li class="ajay">
            Promise me a Million Times is a story of dreams, struggles, friendship and a will to make up for every loss with love by your side. Believing that life always gives us all a 2nd chance is too bookish a thought. Because sometimes, by the time we finally realize our true potential and faults, times have changed dramatically.
